# FDS Public Project Repository
Welcome, I hope to always add new projects, all work is done myself unless specificaly credited otherwise.
All projects are organised by language, then in individual project folders.
Sneak Peeks will be shown here, with relevent information/visuals.

(Please note this repo is a recent creation & I still need to clear publication agreements for larger projects)

## MatLab Projects
1. [**Collision Simulation**](https://github.com/FDSchaefer/public/tree/master/MatLab%20Projects/TriangleCollision) This project involved the implementation of 2D collision mechanics for randomly placed moving ships. Using the main script one would be able to add or remove the number of ships, and take manual control over the frame updates.
